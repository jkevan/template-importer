## Import HTML project

You can import html project in /sites/systemSite/files/ti-project

exemple: using snowboard-site.zip:
snowboard-site.zip:
/snowboard-site
    /snowboard
        /...css
        /...js
    /index.html

the important things:
project need to have an index.html
and links to css, js in it need to use relative paths.

just take this .zip, upload it in /sites/systemSite/files/ti-project, check the checkbox to automatically unzip the archive, and it's done, you should be able to start working on this project in the template importer server setting
